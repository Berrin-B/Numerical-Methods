# Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various numerical methods, which are commonly taught in undergraduate Computational Physics or Numerical Analysis courses. Each script includes clear explanations, professional formatting, and example applications.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bisection_method.py` | Implements the Bisection method to find roots of nonlinear equations. Includes calculation of flight parameters for projectile motion as an example application. |
| `derivative_estimation.py` | Demonstrates derivative estimation using the central difference formula and Richardson extrapolation. |
| `eulers_method.py` | Solves ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Euler's method and compares the approximate solution with the exact analytical solution. |
| `fourth_order_runge_kutta.py` | Implements the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving ODEs with higher accuracy. Compares numerical and exact solutions graphically. |
| `gauss_quadrature.py` | Performs numerical integration using the Gaussian quadrature method (n=2) for high-accuracy approximations. |
| `numerical_integration.py` | Provides implementations of the Trapezoidal and Simpson's methods for definite integrals. Example functions included for practice. |
| `second_order_runge_kutta.py` | Demonstrates the second-order Runge-Kutta method for solving ODEs. Includes examples with adjustable step sizes and parameter `alpha`. |
| `simpson_method.py` | Illustrates Simpson's method for numerical integration, including a probability density function example. |
